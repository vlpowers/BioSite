  <div class="column"><p>I am a 27-year-old with what I feel like is a lot of "job titles" - Yoga Teacher, Personal Trainer, Holistic Nutritionist, and Dental Hygienist but bottom line my passion is Holistic Health and Wellness and helping others. After a handful of "Career path" changes, I finally fully discovered my passion. Throughout my life, beginning at a young age I was subjected to far too much stress, which years down the road caused my digestive system to basically stop working. I had to learn to how to heal myself in a way with food, because medicine only made things worse.

  <div class="column"><p>So, over the last 15 years, I battled and overcame my own health issues, I have seen my sister battle an eating disorder, my mom battle cancer, my brother battle Type 1 Diabetes, as well as my husband’s father and grandfather pass away from cancer. All of this has driven me to really start researching preventative health and wellness, and learning how I can help others. My enneagram number is 7 - Which I find crazy how accurate it is. 7's are often described as extroverted, energetic, optimistic and spontaneous and someone who gets bored easily (TRUTH!!!!) . BUT are always wanting to help others, are easily distracted and exhausted from staying on the go. </p></div>

  <div class="column"><p>I currently live in Colorado with my Husband Kaven and Golden Retriever Astro. We moved to Colorado in 2017 on a whim, with no job lined up we were both just ready for a change. There is so much to do and explore in Colorado, it gives us both a sense of freedom we never had before and definitely see us raising a family in this beautiful state. When I'm not traveling on the weekends, I love to bake, paint, take Hot yoga classes, go hiking in the mountains, visit the Hot springs, or find new breweries and wineries in mountain towns.
